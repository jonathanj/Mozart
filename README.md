# Mozart

An X.org-style character compose key for Windows.

## Installation

Run `mozart.pyw`.

## Usage

The right-hand `Alt` key activates compose mode for two seconds or two
character, whichever comes first. Once the compose mode is activated, normal
input is put on hold while you enter a compose sequence. Upon successfully
entering a compose sequence the composed character appears in the output,
invalid sequences produce a beep and no output.

Compose sequences can be found in `resources/Compose`.
